# Social-Media-Analytics-Project

The goal of this project is to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). The dataset consists of 50,000 reviews, evenly split between positive and negative labels. The project involves preprocessing the text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and handling negation. Feature extraction techniques such as bag-of-words (BOW) and word embeddings are used to transform the text data into numerical vectors. The transformed data is then used to train machine learning models like BERT and LSTM to predict the sentiment of new reviews. The project is implemented using Python and various machine learning and deep learning libraries. The accuracy of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The BERT model achieved an accuracy of approximately 88%, indicating that it can correctly classify the sentiment of most movie reviews. The LSTM model achieved an accuracy of approximately 95.05% on the test set, outperforming the BERT model. The ROC curve and precision-recall curve for the LSTM model show that it is performing better than BERT model. Overall, the results of this project indicate that LSTM model can accurately classify the sentiment of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. This project can be used as a basis for sentiment analysis of other types of text data as well.
